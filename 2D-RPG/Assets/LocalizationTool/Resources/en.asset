  - Hey world!
  - Hi world!
  - Let's do an example of choosing one of multiple options!
  - This will also include an option that will loop back!
  - Now, choose an option! I'll repeat it back to you :)
  - Smile
  - Frown
  - Jump
  - Dance
  - 'You chose: Smile :)'
  - 'You chose: Frown :('
  - "You chose: Jump \u2E02\u2E02\u2E1C(\u0D30\u1D17\u0D30\u0E51)\u2E1D\u2E03\u2E03"
  - "You chose: Dance (\u3065 \u25D5\u203F\u25D5 )\u3065"
  - And then all options lead back here!
